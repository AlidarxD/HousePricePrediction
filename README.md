## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset contains **545 rows** and **13 features**. Below are the key attributes:

| Feature               | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `price`               | Target variable (house price in currency units).         |
| `area`                | Size of the house (square feet).                         |
| `bedrooms`            | Number of bedrooms.                                      |
| `bathrooms`           | Number of bathrooms.                                     |
| `stories`             | Number of floors.                                        |
| `mainroad`            | Proximity to the main road (`yes`/`no`).                 |
| `guestroom`           | Presence of a guestroom (`yes`/`no`).                    |
| `basement`            | Presence of a basement (`yes`/`no`).                     |
| `hotwaterheating`     | Availability of hot water heating (`yes`/`no`).          |
| `airconditioning`     | Availability of air conditioning (`yes`/`no`).           |
| `parking`             | Number of parking spaces.                                |
| `prefarea`            | Located in a preferred area (`yes`/`no`).                |
| `furnishingstatus`    | Furnishing type: `furnished`, `semi-furnished`, `unfurnished`. |

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

1. **Data Distribution**:
   - Histograms reveal the distribution of features like `price`, `area`, and `bedrooms`.

2. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - Insights into feature relationships, showing strong positive correlations of `price` with `area` and `stories`.

3. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Visualized `area` vs. `price`, enhanced with `bedrooms` as a color gradient for better insights.

## üß† Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Logarithmic transformation of skewed features (`bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`).
  - Categorical encoding for binary and multi-class variables.
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.
- **Cross-validation**:
  - Achieved an average \( R^2 \) score of **0.6519**, indicating moderate predictive capability.

---

## üìä Results and Insights

- **Key Drivers of House Price**:
  - **Area**: Larger houses correlate with higher prices.
  - **Stories**: More stories often increase value.
  - **Air Conditioning**: A significant differentiator for pricing.

- **Performance**:
  - The model performs well with scaled features, but further optimization (e.g., non-linear models) could enhance accuracy.
